<p><strong>TEACHING MACHINES: THE HISTORY OF PERSONALIZED LEARNING</strong> (2021)</p>
<p><img style="margin: 15px;" src="/assets/images/susan.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="100" align="right" /><em>Teaching Machines</em> chronicles the twentieth century history of education technology and (as the title suggests) of teaching machines &#8211; specifically, the long-running desire to build machines that will automate and thus improve the efficiency of the education process. It&#8217;s a history that is deeply intertwined with the development of the field of educational psychology and the drive to standardize (and counterintuitively, individualize) the American education system. It&#8217;s a history intertwined with Americans&#8217; obsession with gadgets and a political commitment &#8211; particularly after the launch of the Russian satellite Sputnik &#8211; to make schools more focused on science and technical education. But importantly, it&#8217;s a history that predates the computer by several decades, even though there are so many echoes among the demands for ed-reform from today&#8217;s tech billionaires &#8211; Bill Gates and Mark Zuckerberg, most famously.

<p><strong>CLAIM YOUR DOMAIN</strong> (2015)</p>
<p><img style="margin: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/audreywatters/leaves100x100.png" alt="" width="100" height="100" align="right" />Too often, education technologies are developed that position students as <em>objects</em> of education, a reflection no doubt of how traditional educational practices also view students. Education technologies do things <em>to</em> students, rather than foster student agency. If we are to challenge what "school" should look like, we must also challenge what "ed-tech" does as well. What sorts of technologies can and should we build to give students more control? What sorts of technologies can offer students the power to "own" their learning -- their data, their content, their digital profiles, and their domain? (Publisher: Solution Tree)</p>
